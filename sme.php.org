		<center><img width="600" height="400" alt="" class="css-lightbox" src="images/sme.png"></center>
		<h4 class="css-postheader">SME Market</h4>
			<p>We believe that 80% if not more of the Nigerian populace either directly plays in this market or is served in this market.</p>
			<p>The Telco's example of 'seeing' only the statistic of $2/day as being the average income of 65% of the populace impeded the entry of some major Telco firms to the Nigerian market. This statistic was later shown to have failed to take into consideration other important factors such as the entrepreneurial and family culture of Nigerians.</p>
		<h4 class="css-postheader">Venture Capital Financing</h4>
			<p>ALC wants to continue to profit  from our SMEs as their smallness gives way to economies of sale.</p>
			<p>Furthermore we don't expect the SME market to remain at its current status as the entry to market is low and still unregulated. Thus we intend to leverage on present operation to start and enter the V.C. niche.</p>
		<h4 class="css-postheader">Big Ticket Lease Transactions</h4>
			<p>The Local Content Act has increased the number of Nigerians participating in the Oil and Gas upstream market. Thus the average player in this market has more capacity to take risks thereby participating in new markets or increasing depth in his existing market.</p>
			<p>Equipments like Tug Boats, Wheel Loaders, Concrete Mixers and Dumpers.</p>
		<h4 class="css-postheader">ALC SME Fund Managers</h4>
			<p>ALC has the opportunity to float mutual funds accessing the investing public for such. The term SME is quite subjective as the definition is not fixed or standardizzed. It changes from country to country; from employee size to total gross earnings. The value of Naira to Dollar gives ALC plenty of room to play in as 10% of listed companies on the NSE can be described as an SME using one of the above definitions.</p>

		<h2 class="css-postheader">Why Small Medium Enterprise?</h2>
			<p><em>Definitions:<br />micro: 0-9 employees<br />small: 10-49 employees<br />medium: 50-249 employees</em></p>
			<p>The Nigerian economy tend to replicate far more developed markets over time. SMEs are the backbone of the U.S. economy and the primary source of jobs for Americans, they also account for the largest group of U.S. exporters adn are a major user of imported goods <strong>(office of the US Trade Representative)</strong></p>
			<p>At the start of 2013, there were an estimated 4.9 million businesses in the UK which employed 24.3 million people, and had a combined turnover of &pound;3,300 billion. SMEs accounted for 99.9% of all private sector businesses in the UK, 59.3% of private sector employment and 48.1% of private sector turnover. SMEs employed 14.4 million people and had combined turnover of &pound;1,600 billion. Small businesses alone accounted for 47% of private sector employement and 33.1% of turnover <strong>(Federation of small businesses in the UK)</strong></p>
			<p>With an estimated population of 160,000,000 (one hundred and sixty million) people (2006 census) and a youth population of about 60%, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in its 2012 National Baseline Youth Survey Report stated that 54% of Nigerian youths were unemployed in 2012.</p>
			<p>Unemployment rate in Nigeria increased to 23.90% in 2011 from 21.10% in 2010. From 2006 until 2011, Nigeria Unemployment Rate averaged 14.6% reaching an all-time high of 23.9% in December of 2011 and a record low of 5.3% in December of 2006.</p>
			<p>The Nigerian numbers of unemployed and unemployable persons is of concern to DFIs. Lately the amount and number of funds available to SMEs space in Nigeria has been increased tremenduously; at ALC we are of the opinion that the fear of a breakdown of law and order that could lead to genocide is possibly one of the reasons why such attention is being given to Nigeria. Hence we envisage the availability of these funds for another three to four years in fighting youth unemployment. These funds are normally available as grants payable over 60 to 120 months at single digit rates. <strong>Being an SME provider makes ALC a medium for such receipt of funds.</strong></p>

		<h2 class="css-postheader">The Future - Strategic Intent</h2>
			<p>To compensate more aggressively ALC has identified three thrusts for it to focus on - mid and long-term; thus ALC intends to segment its business into four divisions:</p>
			<p><ol type="1">
				<strong><li>SME Funding</strong>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>Leasing - ONGOING</li>
						<li>Trade Finance - ONGOING</li>
						<li>Term Loans - ONGOING</li>
						<li>Capacity Building - MIDTERM</li>
					</ol></li>
				<strong><li>Leasing via concessions</strong>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>Finance Leases - MIDTERM</li>
						<li>Operating Leases - MIDTERM</li>
					</ol></li>
				<strong><li>Venture Capital</strong>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>Seed and Startup Capital - LONG TERM</li>
						<li>SME Advisory - MIDTERM</li>
					</ol></li>
				<strong><li>Legacy Business</strong></li>
			</ol></p>
			<p>The plan is to have ALC on the main board of the Nigeria Stock Exchange on or before the second half of 2017 and a listing on another West African bourse before 2020.</p>
			<p>The vision for each of the divisions are for them to all become independent companies by 2016/2017.</p>

		<h2 class="css-postheader">Strategic Intent - SME Funding</h2>
			<h4 class="css-postheader">LEASING</h4>
				<p>At ALC, our push is to dominate the Abuja market and be the clear market leader while commencing the second part of the push to enter into new markets of Lagos and P.H.</p>
				<p>Our intent is to focus on groups, associations and cooperatives while not ignoring the individual client, our transaction antecedent shows that the peer pressure of a group assists in ensuring the credit terms are easily complied with.</p>
			<h4 class="css-postheader">TRADE FINANCE</h4>
				<p>The strict compliance with Collateralisation Policy as mandated by the apex bank - CBN seems to crowd out SMEs from accessing available credit in banks. This is another space ALC intends to dominate, the non-availability of capital has restricted our portfolio size. The plan is to spread to other cities in the North.</p>
			<h4 class="css-postheader">TERM LOANS</h4>
				<p>We envisage a continued increase of SMEs seeking funding from other alternatives as banks focus on the big corporate and are risk averse to servicing the SME market while the products are for the retail market and thus more risky</p>
			<h4 class="css-postheader">CAPACITY BUILDING</h4>
				<p>Our experience with our present and past SME clients shows that while a number of them have the entrepreneurial profile, a predominant number of SMEs do not have the knowledge to build businesses. ALC intends to 'partner' with these SMEs to provide a hands-on knowledge-sharing. Sharing with them on building corporate structures, enhancing business systems and the importance of visions, in our pursuit of these ALC will partner a business resource facility firm.</p>		
		<a href="#">Back To Top</a><br />
		<h2 class="css-postheader">Strategic Intent - The Big Ticket Leases</h2>
			<p>ALC intends to participate in both the construction and Oil and Gas sector, these sectors have both seen significant increases in the quantum of value of businesses being done by indigenous companies and the volume of businesses being done by them. These are the group which ALC want to serve. Furthermore, ALC intends to seek assistance of DFIs for couterpart funding for acquisition of some of these assests for the Nigeria market place.</p>
			<p>To ensure a sizeable market share, ALC will offer its clients the opportunity of using either operating or finance lease. Although Operating Leases are associated with more capitalized goods (more risk), the deal profits are significantly better than Finance Leases.</p>
			<p>Furthermore the Big Ticket transactions are what attract traction from businesses through media publicity as this transactions tend to attract publicity. Our experience in finance suggests media mileage are good for the brand of the firm.</p>
			<p>ALC will thus participate in these transactions even as it builds its balance sheet for further businesses.</p>
		<a href="#">Back To Top</a><br />
		<h2 class="css-postheader">Today at ALC</h2>
			<p>The company global credit portfolio is approximately about =&#8358;=1,5000 million (one billion, five hundred million naira). This is inclusive of receivables. ALC currently does not have any operating lease facilities in its books. The largest corporate entity in ALC's books is a private university which cannot be classified as an SME as it has a balance sheet size over &#8358;4 billion, all other credits fall into the category of SMEs or individual accounts.</p>
			<p>The company global lease portfolio (excluding transportation legacy accounts) is =&#8358;=800 million, finance lease adn all in SMES and individuals for the past three years.</p>
			<p>The region coverage in term of cities are Abuja and its environs, Kaduna and Lagos.</p>
			<p>SMEs coverage: ALC's portfolio is more skewed towards cluster/cooperative SMEs although ALC's continue to service the individual SMEs.</p>
			<p>Note: The anomaly here is that the company is generating a revenue of &dollar;2B (@ &dollar;1 = &#8358;160), despite their internal issues. Hence I suggest that the contribution from the different sectors would look like:
