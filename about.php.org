	<h2 class="css-postheader"><a name="advantages"></a>Core Competitive Advantages</h2>
	<ul>
		<li style="line-height: 22.75px;">A strong brand equity in the FCT and the neighboring states, largely thanks to the presence of "Abuja" in the company name that reinforces the trust of people in the Company's stability;</li>
		<li style="line-height: 22.75px;">The support of the Federal Government (ALC was structured as a PPP) which allows ALC to get bank loans at more interesting rates than the competition (19% on average compared to 23% to 25% for other players) and to systematically participate to transportation schemes organized in the northern states.</li>
		<li style="line-height: 22.75px;">A deep knowledge of its environment: Nigeria is a very specific market with strong cultural differences between the northern and southern regions. ALC has accumulated a very deep knowledge of running leasing and transportation operations in the northern environment, which constitutes a strong barrier to entry.</li>
		<li style="line-height: 22.75px;">An effective customer relationship management, with a strong focus on the quality of service (timeliness, comfort and safety) and on the maintenance of the highest ethical standards within the Company; as a result, ALC is currently referred to new customers by several of its existing clients.</li>
